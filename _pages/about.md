I am an enthusiastic Ph.D. student in [Statistical Sciences at the University of Padua](https://www.stat.unipd.it/ricerca/dottorato-di-ricerca). 


My main research interests up until now are:

* Methodological Statistics
* Multivariate Statistics
* Clustering and Classification 

but I am always open to learn and embrace new topics!
